USAGE="Usage: ${bold}pkg dir2repo DIR${endcolour}

Create a Puppy-compatible package repository (repo).

DIR must be a valid directory containing valid packages,
and all packages must have the same file extension.

HOW TO:

Run the command, you will be asked to give a repo name,
repo URL, and optional 'fall back' repos.

The entire contents of the given directory should
then be uploaded to your chosen repo URL.


MORE INFO:

Alongside the packages, a repo file will be generated
in the repo directory, as well as a repo installer file.

You can edit the contents of the following files
before uploading your repo:

Packages-*     <-- the repo file
install        <-- a repo info file (for installing the repo from URL)

SHARING REPOS:

Repos generated in this way and uploaded online can be
installed by other users simply by running this command:

  ${bold}pkg add-repo <your-repo-URL>${endcolour}

SUPPORTED PACKAGES:

Supported packaged types include PET, SFS, DEB, TXZ.
You can use any supported packages types, but you
cannot mix and match them in a single repo.
