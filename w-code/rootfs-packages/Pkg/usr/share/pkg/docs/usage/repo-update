USAGE="Usage: ${bold}pkg repo-update|ru [--ask]${endcolour}

Download and update the latest repo files from their online
sources to get the latest packages available.

This command updates all system (built-in) repos, and any third-party
(user-added) repos as well.

With ${bold}--ask${endcolour} you will be asked to confirm before each
third-party repo is updated.

MORE INFO:

Pkg will look in the following files for system (built-in) repos:

  $HOME/.pkg/sources        <-- lists ALL SUPPORTED system repos
  $HOME/.pkg/sources-all    <-- lists AVAILABLE system repos

(Pkg uses the script '/usr/local/petget/0setup' to update the system repos.)

Pkg will then look in the following files for ${bold}third-party${endcolour} (user-added) repos:

  $HOME/.pkg/sources-user   <-- Pkg-created repos (created using 'dir2repo' command)
  /etc/slackpkg/mirrors     <-- Slackware repos
  /etc/apt/sources.list     <-- Apt repos (Ubuntu, Debian or PPA repos)
  $HOME/.pkg/sources        <-- lists the repo names, repo files, etc
